### :pushpin: Context

As a requirement of the **Qik Serve** technical assessment instructions, the library used in this project was React using the Next.js framework. Currently, the React's team recommends choosing one of the frameworks popular in the community:

> If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community.

**Major assumptions or design choices**

1) I've used TypeScript because you can save time by avoiding bugs due to typos and other errors, it offers faster performance and the IntelliSense works better, generating a superior developer experience.

2) I've chosen the Radix UI because of its optimization related to accessibility.

3) I've used Redux Toolkit to state management.

4) Tailwind CSS was chosen because we can use pre-built CSS classes for styling, which saves time and effort of writing custom CSS from scratch.

5) And finally, for the application deployment, I've picked the Vercel platform because I find it simple to use and also they can generate a preview version of the app for each commit done.
